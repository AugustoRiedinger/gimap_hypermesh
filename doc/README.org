* Case: Permeable with Ferro and Boundary Layers

** About
The sole objective of this case is to create the boundary layers of a continous and orthogonal mesh surrounding the magnet and ferro. The configuration is as follows:

** Creating the base model
The base model (lines) has been created with the CAD tool OnShape:

The main advantage of using this tool instead of Hypermesh is that the lines can be defined as a function of some variables. This is, for example, the size of the magnet has been defined in such a way that if we would like to change it, the boundary lines and the ferro would change accordingly mantaining the configuration.
