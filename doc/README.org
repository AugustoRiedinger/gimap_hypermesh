** About
The sole objective of this case is to create the boundary layers of a continous and orthogonal mesh surrounding the magnet and ferro. The configuration is as follows:

#+CAPTION:Configuration of the Magnet-Ferro test case
#+LABEL:fig:magnet-ferroConfiguration
[[file:../images/magnet-ferroConfiguration.png]]
** Creating the base model
The base model (lines) were created with the CAD tool OnShape:

#+CAPTION:Magnet-ferro OnShape base model
#+LABEL:fig:magnet-ferroOnShape
[[file:../images/magnet-ferroOnShape.png]]

The main advantage of using this tool instead of Hypermesh is that the lines can be defined as a function of some variables. This is, for example, the size of the magnet has been defined in such a way that if we would like to change it, the boundary lines and the ferro would change accordingly mantaining the configuration.

** Importing the base model
To import the base model to Hypermesh, you will need to first export it from OnShape. In order to just export the *lines*, you will have to export the *Sketch part*. This is, right click on the sketch (the pencil symbol; in my case =Top [Sketch]=) and then go to =Export as DXF/DWG ...=. You will then see a window as follows; we will need to export the model as a =DXF= file for Hypermesh to be able to read it.

#+CAPTION:Exporting the model from OnShape
#+LABEL:fig:exportingOnShape
[[file:../images/exportingOnShape.png]]

Now, in Hypermesh go to =File -> Import -> Geometry=. You will see this window in the left side:

#+CAPTION:Importing to Hypermesh
#+LABEL:fig:importingHypermesh
[[file:../images/importingHypermesh.png]]

Then, with the folder symbol search for the =.dxf= file and then click in =Import= on the bottom left side.
** How to move in Hypermesh
In order to affect the view you will have to always mantain the button =Ctrl= pressed in your keyboard.

 + =Ctrl + Mouse Middle Button= resets the view.
 + =Ctrl + Mouse Wheel=: zoom in, zoom out.
 + =Ctrl + Drag Mouse Middle Button=: mark an area to make zoom.
 + =Ctrl + Mouse Left Button=: rotate on a defined point.
 + =Ctrl + Mouse Right Button=: move.

** Deleting lines
The base model has extra lines used to define parameters for variables. They can be easily deleted pressing the =F2= key or the "/X/" symbol on the bottom panel (seventh symbol counting from the left). You will see the following screen:

#+CAPTION:Delete panel for deleting lines
#+LABEL:fig:deletingLines
[[file:../images/deletingLines.png]]

With the downward facing arrow to the left select =lines= instead of the default =elems=. Now, you can click on the lines you want to delete (marked on white):

#+CAPTION:Selecting the lines to delete
#+LABEL:fig:deletingLines2
[[file:../images/deletingLines2.png]]

After marking all the lines to delete, click on the =delete entity= button on the bottom right of the panel. The lines will then be deleted, and you can press =Esc= or the button =return= to go back to the main panel.
**
** Creating the main surface
On the main panel, look to right side and click on =2D=. Then, click the button =spline=. You should see the following panel:

#+CAPTION:Spline panel
#+LABEL:fig:spline
[[file:../images/spline.png]]

Now, press the downwards facing arrow and change the default =mesh, keep surf= option to =surface only= on the panel. You can now select the exterior lines of the surface:

#+CAPTION:Selecting the exterior lines to create the surface
#+LABEL:fig:splineExteriorLines
[[file:../images/splineExteriorLines.png]]

You can now press the button =create= and the surface will be created. In order to renderize it you will have to press the =Shaded Geometry and Surface Edges= button on the top side of the panel (12th counting from the left):

#+CAPTION:Renderized Surface
#+LABEL:fig:splineRenderizedSurface
[[file:../images/splineRenderizedSurface.png]]

Press =Esc= or =return= to go back to the main panel.
** Adjusting the tolerance
This step is necessary in order to create tinier elements. Press the key =o= and you will be redirected to the following panel:

#+CAPTION:Tolerance Geometry
#+LABEL:fig:toleranceGeometry
[[file:../images/toleranceGeometry.png]]

Here, change the value of =cleanup tol= to =1e-7=. Then, press the =mesh= button on the left side:

#+CAPTION:Tolerance Mehs
#+LABEL:fig:toleranceMesh
[[file:../images/toleranceMesh.png]]

We should change the =element size= to =1e-5= and the =node tol= to 1e-6. We can now press =Esc= and go back to the main panel.
** Trimming the lines
We should now trim the lines to create the different surfaces. For this, press =Geom= on the right side of the main panel, and then go to =surface edit=. You should see a panel similar to this:

#+CAPTION:Surface Edit
#+LABEL:fig:surfaceEdit
[[file:../images/surfaceEdit.png]]

Here, in the second column (middel), press the downward facing arrow and change the default =free lines= to just =lines=. Just below that, press the scroll button and change the default =along a vector= to =normal to the surface=. You should now have a panel that looks the same as the figure above.

The procedure to trim the lines is as follows:

  1. Press the =surfs= button on the first column (to the left) and select the main surface. It should now appear in white.

#+CAPTION:Surface Edit Select Surface
#+LABEL:fig:surfaceEditSelectSurface
[[file:../images/surfaceEditSelectSurface.png]]

 2. Press the =line= button on the mid column, and the press it again to select =displayed= and mar                                                                                                                                                                        k all the lines to trim.

#+CAPTION:Surface Edit Select Lines
#+LABEL:fig:surfaceEditSelectLines
[[file:../images/surfaceEditSelectLines.png]]

 3. Now we can press =trim= on the right side and the surface will be trimmed.

** Meshing with automesh
In the main panel, press the =2D= button on the right side and then =automesh=. You should see a panel similar to this:

#+CAPTION:automesh
#+LABEL:fig:automesh
[[file:../images/automesh.png]]

Then, change the default =mixed= to =quad only= and the =element size= to =0.01=. Now, you can press the =surfs= button on the left, and start picking every surface except the boundary layers. The end result should look like this (selected surfaces marked in white):

#+CAPTION:automesh3
#+LABEL:fig:automesh3
[[file:../images/automesh3.png]]

We can now press the =mesh= button on the right side and we should see a meshing like this:

#+CAPTION:automesh4
#+LABEL:fig:automesh4
[[file:../images/automesh4.png]]

Now we press the button =return=, and we can start selecting the boundary layers. It should look like this:

#+CAPTION:automesh5
#+LABEL:fig:automesh5
[[file:../images/automesh5.png]]

Now we shall change the tolerance or =element size= to 0.001 and press the button =mesh=. The end result should look like this:

#+CAPTION:automesh6
#+LABEL:fig:automesh6
[[file:../images/automesh6.png]]

#+CAPTION:automesh7
#+LABEL:fig:automesh7
[[file:../images/automesh7.png]]
** Creating a collector for the surface
We shall now create a collector for the surface as a preamble to the drag. For this, press the =Components= icon on the top side of the main panel (second icon counting from the left):

#+CAPTION:mainSurface
#+LABEL:fig:mainSurface
[[file:../images/mainSurface.png]]

Create a name for the new component in =component name=. In this case, we named the new collector =mainSurface=. We shall then press the =create= button an return to the main panel.

Now, press =Tool= on the right side of the main panel, and then press =organize=. We will now move all the components from =auto1= (the default collector) to the new collector =mainSurface=.

#+CAPTION:mainSurface2
#+LABEL:fig:mainSurface2
[[file:../images/mainSurface2.png]]

We select all the elements with the =elems= button, and then we change =dest components= to =mainSurface= as seen in the above figure. We can now press the =move= button and all the elements will be redirected to the new collector.

Now, in the bottom right side of the main panel, change the collector from =auto1= to =mainSurface=.
** Drag - Creating the 3D model
In the main panel - 2D section, press the =drag= button. The steps to follow now are:

 + On the left side of the panel, press =drag elems= instead of =drag geom=.
 + Select =2d elems= and then select =all=.
 + Change =N1, N2, N3= to =z-axis=.
 + Change the =distance= to =1.0= and =on drag= also to =1=.

The options should look like this:

#+CAPTION:drag1
#+LABEL:fig:drag1
[[file:../images/drag1.png]]

We can now press the =drag+= button and the end result should look like this:

#+CAPTION:drag2
#+LABEL:fig:drag2
[[file:../images/drag2.png]]
