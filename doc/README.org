* Case: Permeable with Ferro and Boundary Layers

** About
The sole objective of this case is to create the boundary layers of a continous and orthogonal mesh surrounding the magnet and ferro. The configuration is as follows:

** Creating the base model
The base model (lines) were created with the CAD tool OnShape:

The main advantage of using this tool instead of Hypermesh is that the lines can be defined as a function of some variables. This is, for example, the size of the magnet has been defined in such a way that if we would like to change it, the boundary lines and the ferro would change accordingly mantaining the configuration.

** Importing the base model
To import the base model to Hypermesh, you will need to first export it from OnShape. In order to just export the *lines*, you will have to export the *Sketch part*. This is, right click on the sketch (the pencil symbol; in my case =Top [Sketch]=) and then go to =Export as DXF/DWG ...=. You will then see a window as follows; we will need to export the model as a =DXF= file for Hypermesh to be able to read it.

Now, in Hypermesh go to =File -> Import -> Geometry=. You will see this window in the left side:

Then, with the folder symbol search for the =.dxf= file and then click in =Import= on the bottom left side.
