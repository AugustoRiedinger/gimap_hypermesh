** About
The sole objective of this case is to create the boundary layers of a continous and orthogonal mesh surrounding the magnet and ferro. The configuration is as follows:

** Creating the base model
The base model (lines) were created with the CAD tool OnShape:

The main advantage of using this tool instead of Hypermesh is that the lines can be defined as a function of some variables. This is, for example, the size of the magnet has been defined in such a way that if we would like to change it, the boundary lines and the ferro would change accordingly mantaining the configuration.

** Importing the base model
To import the base model to Hypermesh, you will need to first export it from OnShape. In order to just export the *lines*, you will have to export the *Sketch part*. This is, right click on the sketch (the pencil symbol; in my case =Top [Sketch]=) and then go to =Export as DXF/DWG ...=. You will then see a window as follows; we will need to export the model as a =DXF= file for Hypermesh to be able to read it.

Now, in Hypermesh go to =File -> Import -> Geometry=. You will see this window in the left side:

#+CAPTION:Importing to Hypermesh
#+LABEL:fig:importingHypermesh

Then, with the folder symbol search for the =.dxf= file and then click in =Import= on the bottom left side.
** Deleting lines
The base model has extra lines used to define parameters for variables. They can be easily deleted pressing the =F2= key or the "/X/" symbol on the bottom panel (seventh symbol counting from the left). You will see the following screen:

#+CAPTION:Delete panel for deleting lines
#+LABEL:fig:deletingLines
[[file:../images/deletingLines.png]]

With the downward facing arrow to the left select =lines= instead of the default =elems=. Now, you can click on the lines you want to delete (marked on white):

#+LABEL:fig:deletingLines2

After marking all the lines to delete, click on the =delete entity= button on the bottom right of the panel. The lines will then be deleted, and you can press =Esc= or the button =return= to go back to the main panel.
